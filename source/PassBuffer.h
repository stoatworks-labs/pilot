/**
    An off-screen buffer for one stage of the chain.

    Two things on top of the SDK's FFGLFBO.

    **It reallocates only when it has to.** The chain is sized by the
    television system, not by the composition, so the signal buffers keep their
    size across a resolution change while the output-sized ones do not. Ensure()
    is called every frame and is a no-op in the overwhelming majority of them.

    **It actually frees its colour texture.** `ffglex::FFGLFBO::Release()`
    deletes the framebuffer and the depth renderbuffer, then tests
    `depthBufferID` a second time where it plainly meant `colorTextureID` --
    so the colour texture is leaked on every release (SDK b1afaf9,
    `FFGLFBO.cpp`). One leak would not matter; this plugin drops and rebuilds
    every buffer whenever the system or the composition size changes, and
    somebody auditioning NTSC against PAL a few times should not be paying
    megabytes of texture memory for each comparison.
